RoverInterviewProject is a project that I originally completed in the spring of 2018 while interviewing for a position with Rover.com. In short, the assignment required me to create a rudimentary website with some basic functionality to emulate Rover.com, and to populate that website with some data from a provided .csv file. The full assignment can be read [here](https://github.com/sbishop411/RoverInterviewProject/blob/master/Docs/Assignment.md). I chose the [MEAN stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)) for the project, which afforded me many opportunities to learn and experiment with several technologies that I hadn't had the change to otherwise.

**Note:** This project was originally uploaded and completed in a repository that was forked from a private repository owned by [roverjobs](https://github.com/roverjobs). Since it's not possible to remove the fork relationship after a repository is created, this repo is an independent recreation of the original one, which has resulted in the loss of the original commit history.
